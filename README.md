# Oracle AI Explorer for Apps

<!-- spell-checker:ignore streamlit, venv, setuptools -->

ðŸš§ The **AI Explorer** is currently in *Beta*

## Description

The **Oracle AI Explorer for Apps** (the **AI Explorer**) provides a streamlined environment where developers and data scientists can explore the potential of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities. By integrating **Oracle Database 23ai** AI Vector Search, the Sandbox enables users to enhance existing Large Language Models (LLMs) through RAG.

- Container Runtime e.g. docker/podman (for running in a Container)
- Access to an Embedding and Chat Model:
  - API Keys for Third-Party Models
  - On-Premises Models<sub>\*</sub>

<sub>\*Oracle recommends running On-Premises Models on hardware with GPUs. For more information, please review the [Infrastructure](https://oracle-samples.github.io/ai-explorer/infrastructure) documentation.</sub>

#### Bare-Metal Installation

# Oracle AI Explorer for Apps

<!-- spell-checker:ignore streamlit, venv, setuptools -->

🚧 The **AI Explorer** is currently in *Beta*

## Description

The **Oracle AI Explorer for Apps** (the **AI Explorer**) provides a streamlined environment where developers and data scientists can explore the potential of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities. By integrating **Oracle Database 23ai** AI Vector Search, the Sandbox enables users to enhance existing Large Language Models (LLMs) through RAG.

- [Testbed for auto-generated or existing Q&A datasets](https://oracle-samples.github.io/ai-explorer/client/testbed)

## Getting Started

The **AI Explorer** is available to install in your own environment, which may be a developer's desktop, on-premises data center environment, or a cloud provider. It can be run either on bare-metal, within a container, or in a Kubernetes Cluster.

For more information, including more details on **Setup and Configuration** please visit the [documentation](https://oracle-samples.github.io/ai-explorer).

### Prerequisites

- Oracle Database 23ai incl. Oracle Database 23ai Free
- Python 3.11 (for running Bare-Metal)
- Container Runtime e.g. docker/podman (for running in a Container)
- Access to an Embedding and Chat Model:
  - API Keys for Third-Party Models
  - On-Premises Models<sub>\*</sub>

<sub>\*Oracle recommends running On-Premises Models on hardware with GPUs. For more information, please review the [Infrastructure](https://oracle-samples.github.io/ai-explorer/infrastructure) documentation.</sub>

#### Bare-Metal Installation

To run the application on bare-metal; download the [source](https://github.com/oracle-samples/ai-explorer) and from `src/`:

1. Create and activate a Python Virtual Environment:

   ```bash
   cd src/
   python3.11 -m venv .venv --copies
   source .venv/bin/activate

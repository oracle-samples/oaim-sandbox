You are responsible for ensuring that Your use of these non-Oracle cloud \nservices complies with the policies and terms that govern the use of these non-Oracle cloud services.   \nThe Oracle Visual Builder Cloud Service - Classic - Government  is a low-code app development \nsolution for creating, extending, and customizing business apps.  Users may create and publish hosted \nweb applications that work on mobile devices and web browsers through visual development of user \ninterfaces, business objects, and business logic.  The Oracle Visual Builder Cloud Service - Classic - \nGovernment is based on an extensible, standards-based, component architecture, and supports the \nintegration and extension of Oracle PaaS and SaaS Cloud Services as well as third party REST-based \nservices.  This includes the ability to create, copy, edit, and delete applications in the Oracle Visual \nBuilder Cloud Service \u2013 Classic - Government, as well as to version, stage, and publish those applications \nas part of application lifecycle management.   \nThe Oracle Blockchain Platform Cloud Service  provides a pre-assembled platform on Oracle Cloud \nfor building and running chaincode and maintaining a distributed ledger for business transactions.  \nWith the racle Blockchain Platform Cloud Service, users can create a new blockchain network or join an \nexisting blockchain network, which is ready for chaincode deployment.  Chaincode functions, also \nknown as transactions, can be invoked from end-user applications via private channels.  Users are also \nauthorized to perform tasks related to administration and monitoring of the network.   \nIn addition to the above, Oracle Blockchain Platform Cloud Service \u2013 Enterprise \u2013 Government provides \nscalability and high availability by distributing workload across multiple availability domains and\/or \nfault domains.   \n \nOracle APEX Application Development \u2013 Government delivers Oracle Application Express (APEX) as \na managed Cloud Service. It adds to APEX important benefits of Oracle Autonomous Database (ADB) \nand Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). This Cloud Service provides APEX with an Oracle Autonomous \nTransaction Processing Serverless (ATP-S) database and a managed middle tier.  \nThe included database, which hosts APEX and its corresponding applications and data, is fully elastic. \nYou specify the number of Cloud Service OCPUs and the database storage capacity. You must use \nOracle Autonomous Transaction Processing \u2013 Exadata Storage for the storage. At any time, You may \nscale, increase, or decrease either OCPUs or storage capacity without incurring downtime.  \nThe included middle-tier exposes APEX over HTTPS and also provides tools such as Oracle REST Data \nServices (ORDS) and SQL Developer Web (SDW). You may use these extra tools only in support of APEX \napplications. For example, You may create custom REST endpoints on application data using SDW or \nAPEX. You are prohibited from any ORDS usage that directly accesses the pre-configured REST-SQL \nendpoint (with URL ending in \/sql). \nAs part of Oracle APEX Application Development \u2013 Government, Oracle may allow You to create \npreview service instances.  Preview service instances enable You to develop and test Your application \nwith upcoming service releases prior to the general deployment of those service releases to all service \ninstances.  Preview service instances are available for a limited duration.  During the creation of a \npreview service instance, You will be provided an end date for the preview period, and Your preview \nservice instance will be terminated on this date.

You can also provision units of execution ahead of time to experience consistent low \nlatencies, and pay only for any unused capacity that You provision.  The Oracle Functions Cloud \nService is built on the open source Fn Project which, unlike with most cloud functions platforms, \nmeans no vendor lock-in.   \n \nMeasurement and Usage of the Oracle Functions Cloud Service: \n\uf0b7 Execution Time:  The time a function is spent executing, measured in gigabyte-seconds. \n\uf0b7 Unused Provisioned Concurrency Units: The time provisioned concurrency units are \nprovisioned, but not used to execute a function.  Provisioned concurrency units are metered \nagainst the execution time at 25% of the 10,000 Gigabyte Memory-Seconds that remained \nunused \n.   \nOracle Cloud Infrastructure API Gateway  is a fully managed, regional gateway that integrates with \nYour network on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.  \n \nOracle Cloud Infrastructure API Gateway fronts public or private APIs, processes incoming requests \nfrom a client, applies policies for security, availability and validation, forwards requests to back-end \nservices, applyies policies to the response from a back-end and forwards the response to the client.  \n \nOracle Cloud Infrstructure API Gateway protects and isolates back-end services and help You meter API \ncalls.  Connections from clients to the Oracle Cloud Infrastrucutre API Gateway alway use transport level \nsecurity (TLS) to ensure the privacy and integrity of data flowing between clients and the API Gateway.  \nFor flexibility, You can configure the connections from the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure API Gateway to \nback-end services with or without TLS.  If You  do not use TLS between Your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure \nAPI Gateway and back-end services You do so at Your own risk. \n \nThe Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE)  is a managed, enterprise grade container \norchestration service. OKE provides a managed Kubernetes service for customers to simply and \nsecurely, deploy and operate their containerized applications at scale. OKE is offered as a managed \nservice that runs on Oracle's high-performance, low-cost infrastructure. Using OKE helps reduce the \ntime and cost to build and manage cloud native applications. OKE leverages open-source technologies, \nenabling You to build applications for workload portability and to simplify operations. There is no \nadditional charge to use OKE. Customers pay for the compute, storage, or other infrastructure \nresources consumed. \n \nOS Management Service is an infrastructure service that provides tools needed by administrators to \nmonitor and manage operating system activities in Oracle Cloud tenancies.  OS Management is a cross-\nplatform solution, providing support for both Linux and Windows environments.  With OS \nManagement, users have a centralized management solution for installing packages and updates, \nincluding applying critical security updates without downtime using Ksplice.  In addition, the service \noffers application discovery, monitoring for critical events on the platform (like Kernel aborts) and \ninspecting status for Autonomous Linux instances running in the tenancy.   OS Management is not \navailable with Free Tier shapes.",

Add new code to WebController.java to process the request and response.\n4. Create a HTML page incrementSalary.html to display the results.\nDeclare a new method incrementSalary(int)\nThe incrementSalary(int) method updates the salary value of all employees by\nincrementing the value according to a given percentage.\nClass Name: src\/main\/java\/com\/oracle\/jdbc\/samples\/bean\/JavaBean.java.\nGithub Location: JavaBean.java\nSteps to declare a new method:\n1. Open the JdbcBean.java file in IntelliJ. To create the JdbcBean.java class, refer to \nCreating a Java Bean Interface for a JDBC Connection. Use the same class and declare\nnew methods for each one of the functionalities.\n2. Declare a method incrementSalary(int) that takes an integer for percentage as an\ninput parameter.\npublic List<Employee> incrementSalary(int incrementPct);\n8-1\n\nDocument 48: Implement a new method incrementSalary(int)\nThe incrementSalary(int) method enables you to increment the salary of all\nemployees according to a given percentage.\nClass Name: src\/main\/java\/com\/oracle\/jdbc\/samples\/bean\/JavaBeanImpl.java\nGithub Location: JavaBeanImpl.java\nSteps to Implement a new method:\n1. Open the JdbcBeanImpl.java file in IntelliJ. To create the JdbcBeanImpl.java\nclass, refer to Creating a Java Bean Implementation for a JDBC Connection. Use\nthe same class and add new implementation methods for each one of the\nfunctionalities.\n2. Add the following code snippet to implement the incrementSalary(int) method:\npublic List<Employee> incrementSalary (int incrementPct) {\n  List<Employee> returnValue = new ArrayList<>();\n  \n\/* Get the database connection*\/\n  try (Connection connection = getConnection()) {\n    try (CallableStatement callableStatement = \n        connection.prepareCall(\"begin ? :=  \nrefcur_pkg.incrementsalary(?); end;\")) {\n          callableStatement.registerOutParameter(1, \nOracleTypes.CURSOR);\n          callableStatement.setInt(2, incrementPct);\n          callableStatement.execute();\n          try (ResultSet resultSet = (ResultSet) \ncallableStatement.getObject(1)) {\n            while (resultSet.next()) {\n              returnValue.add(new Employee(resultSet));\n            }\n          }\n    }\n  } catch (SQLException ex) {\n\/* Catch the SQLException and log the message in the logger*\/\n    logger.log(Level.SEVERE, null, ex);\n    ex.printStackTrace();\n  }\nreturn returnValue;\n}\nAdd the Code to a Servlet\nAdd the relevant code to WebController.java to give a salary raise to all employees.\nClass Name: src\/main\/java\/com\/oracle\/jdbc\/samples\/web\/WebController.java\nChapter 8\nImplement a new method incrementSalary(int)\n8-2",

JDBC Driver, UCP:\nUse the latest 23ai versions of JDBC drivers and UCP.\nNote:\nDownload the latest JDBC drivers and UCP from the JDBC and UCP Downloads\npage\n3. JDK Version\nUse a JDK version that is compatible with Oracle Database Release 23ai. Refer to Version\nCompatibility for Oracle JDBC Drivers for more details.\n4. Auto-Closeable Statements\nStarting JDK7, \u2018Auto-closeable statements\u2019 has been introduced, that close by default without\nan explicit catch statement.\n5. Use PreparedStatement instead of Statement objects:\nStatement in JDBC must be localized to being used for DDL (ALTER, CREATE, GRANT etc)\nsince these commands cannot accept bind variables.\nUse PreparedStatement or CallableStatement for any other type of statement.

After having downloaded and unzipped the SpringAI file from the [Settings](../client/configuration/settings) screen, you can open and set the latest two things in the code to be executed. For the detailed description, please refer to the **README.md** file included

### Prerequisites
Before using a microservice that exploit OpenAI API, make sure you have a developer token from OpenAI. To do this, create an account at [OpenAI Signup](https://platform.openai.com/signup) and generate the token at [API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).


The Spring AI project defines a configuration property named: `spring.ai.openai.api-key`, that you should set to the value of the **API Key** got from `openai.com`.

Exporting an environment variable is one way to set that configuration property.

```bash
export SPRING_AI_OPENAI_API_KEY=<INSERT KEY HERE>
```

Setting the API key is all you need to run the application. However, you can find more information on setting started in the [Spring AI reference documentation section on OpenAI Chat](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/clients/openai-chat.html).

### Run the microservice standalone

You have simply to:

* change the permissions to the `env.sh` file to be executed with: 

```bash
chmod 755 ./env.sh
```

* add the password for the user used to connect from the {{ .Site.Params.LongName | markdownify }} to the Oracle DB23ai used as vectorstore: 

```bash
export DB_PASSWORD=""
```

* drop the table `SPRING_AI_VECTORS` if exists, on which it will be automatically converted and ingested the langchain table used to store the embeddings part of the Chatbot configuration:

```sql
DROP TABLE SPRING_AI_VECTORS CASCADE CONSTRAINTS;
COMMIT;
```

This microservice will expose the following REST endpoints:

* `http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions`: to use RAG via OpenAI REST API
* `http://localhost:8080/v1/service/llm`: to chat straight with the LLM used
* `http://localhost:8080/v1/service/search/`: to search for document similar to the message provided

### Run in the Oracle Backend for Microservices and AI

Thanks to the GPU node pool support of the latest release, it is possible to deploy the Spring Boot microservice in it, leveraging private LLMs too. These are the steps to be followed:

* Add in `application-obaas.yml` the **OPENAI_API_KEY**, if the deployment is based on the OpenAI LLM services:

```yaml
openai:
      base-url: 
      api-key: <OPENAI_API_KEY>
```

* Build, depending the provider `<ollama|openai>`:

```bash
mvn clean package -DskipTests -P <ollama|openai> -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=obaas
```

* let’s do the setup, one time only, for the **Ollama** server running in the **Oracle Backend for Microservices and AI**. Prepare an `ollama-values.yaml` to include the LLMs used in your chatbot configuration. Example:

```yaml
ollama:
  gpu:
    enabled: true
    type: 'nvidia'
    number: 1
  models:
    - llama3.1
    - llama3.2
    - mxbai-embed-large
    - nomic-embed-text
nodeSelector:
  node.kubernetes.io/instance-type: VM.GPU.A10.1
```

* execute the helm chart to deploy in the kubernetes cluster:

```bash
kubectl create ns ollama
helm install ollama ollama-helm/ollama --namespace ollama  --values ollama-values.yaml
```

* check if it has been correctly installed in this way:

```bash
kubectl -n ollama exec svc/ollama -- ollama ls
```

it should be:


```bash
NAME                        ID              SIZE      MODIFIED      
nomic-embed-text:latest     0a109f422b47    274 MB    3 minutes ago    
mxbai-embed-large:latest    468836162de7    669 MB    3 minutes ago    
llama3.1:latest             a80c4f17acd5    2.0 GB    3 minutes ago
```

* test a single LLM:

```bash
kubectl -n ollama exec svc/ollama -- ollama run "llama3.1" "what is spring boot?"
```

**NOTICE**: The Microservices will access to the ADB23ai on which the vector store table should be created, as done in the local desktop example shown before. To access the {{ .Site.Params.LongName | markdownify }} running on **Oracle Backend for Microservices and AI** and create the same configuration, let’s do:

* tunnel:

```bash
kubectl -n ai-explorer port-forward svc/ai-explorer 8181:8501
```

* on localhost, connect to : `http://localhost:8181/ai-explorer`

* Deploy with `oractl` on a new schema `vector`:

* kubernetes tunnel from one side:

```bash
kubectl -n obaas-admin port-forward svc/obaas-admin 8080:8080
```

* and with the oractl command line utility:

```bash
oractl:> create --app-name rag 
oractl:> bind --app-name rag --service-name myspringai --username vector
```

The `bind` will create the new user, if not exists, but to have the `SPRING_AI_VECTORS` table compatible with SpringAI Oracle vector store adapter, the microservices needs to access to the vector store table created by the {{ .Site.Params.LongName | markdownify }} with user ADMIN on ADB, for example:

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON ADMIN.MXBAI_EMBED_LARGE_512_103_COSINE TO vector;
```

* So, then you can deploy it:

```bash
oractl:> deploy --app-name rag --service-name myspringai --artifact-path <ProjectDir>/target/myspringai-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --image-version 0.0.1 --java-version ghcr.io/oracle/graalvm-native-image-obaas:21 --service-profile obaas
```

* test opening first a new tunnel:

```bash
kubectl -n rag port-forward svc/myspringai 9090:8080
```

* and finally from shell, if you have built a vector store on this doc "[Oracle® Database
Get Started with Java Development](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/tdpjd/get-started-java-development.pdf)" :

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:9090/v1/chat/completions" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key" \
     -d '{"message": "Can I use any kind of development environment to run the example?"}' | jq .
```

it should return something like:

```bash

{
  "choices": [
    {
      "message": {
        "content": "Based on the provided documents, it seems that a specific development environment (IDE) is recommended for running the example.\n\nIn document \"67D5C08DF7F7480F\", it states: \"This guide uses IntelliJ Idea community version to create and update the files for this application.\" (page 17)\n\nHowever, there is no information in the provided documents that explicitly prohibits using other development environments. In fact, one of the articles mentions \"Application. Use these instructions as a reference.\" without specifying any particular IDE.\n\nTherefore, while it appears that IntelliJ Idea community version is recommended, I couldn't find any definitive statement ruling out the use of other development environments entirely.\n\nIf you'd like to run the example with a different environment, it might be worth investigating further or consulting additional resources. Sorry if this answer isn't more conclusive!"
      }
    }
  ]
}

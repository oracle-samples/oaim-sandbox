Once you are happy with the specific configuration of your **Sandbox**, the settings can be exported in **.json** format.  Those settings can then be loaded in later to return the **Sandbox** to your previous configuration.  The settings an also be imported into another instance of the **Sandbox**.

## View and Download

To view and download the **Sandbox** configuration, navigate to `Configuration -> Settings`:

{{< icon "triangle-exclamation" >}} Settings contain sensitive information such as database passwords and API Keys.  By default, these settings will not be exported and will have to be re-entered after uploading the settings in a new instance of the **Sandbox**.

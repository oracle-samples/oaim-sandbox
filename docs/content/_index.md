The {{< full_app_ref >}} provides a streamlined environment where developers and data scientists can explore the potential of Generative Artificial Intelligence (**GenAI**) combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (**RAG**) capabilities. By integrating Oracle Database AI Vector Search, the {{< short_app_ref >}} enables users to enhance existing Large Language Models (**LLM**s) through **RAG**. This method significantly improves the performance and accuracy of AI models, helping to avoid common issues such as knowledge cutoff and hallucinations.

- **GenAI**: Powers the generation of text, images, or other data based on prompts using pre-trained **LLM**s.
- **RAG**: Enhances **LLM**s by retrieving relevant, real-time information allowing models to provide up-to-date and accurate responses.
- **Vector Database**: A database, including Oracle Database 23ai, that can natively store and manage vector embeddings and handle the unstructured data they describe, such as documents, images, video, or audio.

## {{< short_app_ref >}} Features

- [Configuring Embedding and Chat Models](client/configuration/model_config)
- [Splitting and Embedding Documentation](client/tools/split_embed)
- [Modifying System Prompts (Prompt Engineering)](client/tools/prompt_eng)
- [Experimenting with **LLM** Parameters](client/chatbot)
- [Testbed for auto-generated or existing Q&A datasets](client/testbed)

The {{< short_app_ref >}} streamlines the entire workflow from prototyping to production, making it easier to create and deploy RAG-powered GenAI solutions using the **Oracle Database**.

# Getting Started

The {{< short_app_ref >}} is available to install in your own environment, which may be a developer's desktop, on-premises data center environment, or a cloud provider. It can be run either on bare-metal, within a container, or in a Kubernetes Cluster.

<!-- Hard-coding AI Explorer to avoid unsafe HTML, this is an exception -->
The [Walkthrough](walkthrough) is a great way to familiarize yourself with the **AI Explorer** and its features in a development environment.

## Prerequisites

- Oracle Database 23ai incl. Oracle Database 23ai Free
- Python 3.11 (for running Bare-Metal)
- Container Runtime e.g. docker/podman (for running in a Container)
- Access to an Embedding and Chat Model:
  - API Keys for Third-Party Models
  - On-Premises Models*

~\*Oracle recommends running On-Premises Models on hardware with GPUs. For more information, please review the [{{< short_app_ref >}}](client/) documentation.~

### Bare-Metal Installation

To run the application on bare-metal; download the [source]({{ .Site.Params.GitHubRepo }}) and from the `src/` directory:

1. Create and activate a Python Virtual Environment:

   ```bash
   cd src/
   python3.11 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip3.11 install --upgrade pip wheel
   ```

1. Install the Python modules:

   ```bash
    pip3.11 install -e ".[all]"
   ```

1. Start Streamlit:

   ```bash
   streamlit run oai_client.py --server.port 8501
   ```

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.

1. [Configure](client/configuration) the {{< short_app_ref >}}.

### Container Installation

{{% notice style="code" title="Same... but Different" icon="circle-info" %}}
References to `podman` commands, if applicable to your environment, can be substituted with `docker`.
{{% /notice %}}

To run the application in a container; download the [source]({{ .Site.Params.GitHubRepo }}) and from the top-level directory:

1. Build the image.

   From inside the `src/` directory, build the *oai-explorer-aio* image:

   ```bash
   cd src/
   podman build -t oai-explorer-aio .
   ```

1. Start the Container:

   ```bash
   podman run -p 8501:8501 -it --rm oai-explorer-aio
   ```

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.

1. [Configure](client/configuration) the {{< short_app_ref >}}.

### Advanced Installation

The {{< short_app_ref >}} is designed to operate within a Microservices Architecture, leveraging Microservices Infrastructure like Kubernetes.
Review [{{< short_app_ref >}}](client) components and the additional [Microservices](advanced/microservices) documentation for more information.
